// there's no proxy at all. So it reads "http" both for "DSM forwarded a
// plain-HTTP visitor request for pinhaoshe.ca" (should redirect) and for
// "someone hit http://<NAS-IP>:3000 directly" (must NOT redirect — that's
// how the README's first-run setup reaches the app before HTTPS exists).
// Only the production hostname distinguishes the two, so gate on both — and
// on APP_BASE_URL itself being an https:// origin, so this is a no-op in
// local dev (APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000" there) even though the
